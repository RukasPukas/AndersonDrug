          ><br /><br />

          • Any patient who may harm themselves or others may be gently
          restrained to prevent injury to the patient or crew. This restraint
          must be in a humane manner and used only as a last resort. Other means
          to prevent injury to the patient or crew must be attempted first.
          These efforts could include reality orientation, distraction
          techniques, or other less restrictive therapeutic means. Physical or
          chemical restraint should be a last resort technique<br /><br />
        </p>

          <span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold">Procedure:</span
          ><br /><br />
          1. Attempt less restrictive means of managing the patient.<br /><br />

          2. Request law enforcement assistance wherever and whenever
          possible.<br /><br />

          3. Ensure adequate personnel are present. This generally means four
          people, one for each of the patient’s extremities.<br /><br />

          4. Restrain the patient in a lateral or supine position. No devices
          such as backboards, splints, or other devices will be on top of the
          patient.
          <strong
            ><u
              >The patient will never be restrained in the prone position.</u
            ></strong
          ><br /><br />

          5. The patient’s upper extremities should be restrained with one arm
          at or above the level of the head and one arm at or below the waist
          level if possible, unless clinically inappropriate. <br /><br />

          6. The patient must be under constant observation of the EMS crew at
          <u>ALL</u> times. This includes direct visualization of the patient as
          well as cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring whenever possible.<br /><br />

          7. The extremities that are restrained will have a circulation check
          at least every 15 minutes. The first of these checks should occur as
          soon after placement of the restraints as possible. This
          <u>MUST</u> be documented in the patient care report (PCR).<br /><br />

          8. Documentation in the PCR should include the reason for the use of
          restraints, the type of restraints used, and the time restraints were
          placed.<br /><br />

          9. If the above actions are unsuccessful, or if the patient is
          resisting the restraints, consider administering medications per the
          <a
            href="../../SOGSources/AdultMedical/AgitatedSources/Agitated.html"
            class="working-link"
            title="Behavioral Emergencies SOG"
            >AGITATED OR VIOLENT PATIENT / BEHAVIORAL EMERGENCIES</a
          >
          Protocol.<br /><br />

          10. If a patient is restrained by law enforcement personnel with
          handcuffs or other devices EMS personnel cannot remove, a law
          enforcement officer must accompany the patient to the hospital in the
          transporting ambulance.<br /><br />

          11. All restraints should have the ability to be quickly released, if
          necessary.
