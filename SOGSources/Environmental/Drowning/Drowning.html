          <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
            • The World Health Organization definition of drowning is “the process of experiencing respiratory
            impairment from submersion / immersion in liquid”.<br><br>
            • Drowning is further defined in the following categories:
            <br><br>
                <span class="Indention">
                a. Non-fatal drowning – patients rescued from drowning.<br><br>
                b. Fatal drowning – any death, acutely or subacutely, resultant from drowning.
                </span><br>
            • Submersion refers to situations in which the patient’s airway is underwater. Immersion refers to situations
            in which the patient’s body is in water but the patient’s airway remains out of the water.<br><br>
            • Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure patient is rapidly
            accessed and removed from the water.<br><br>
            • Initiation of in-water ventilations may increase survival – In-water chest compressions are futile.<br><br>
            • Long-standing teaching has suggested that rescuers should always assume c-spine injury in victims of
            drowning.<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">
            a. Rescuers should maintain a high index of suspicion for a spinal injury based on mechanisms listed
            below.<br><br>
            b. Mechanisms of injury highly suggestive of cervical spine injury include diving, water skiing, surfing
            or watercraft accidents.
            </span><br>
            • Patients may develop subacute respiratory difficulty after drowning and therefore all victims of drowning
            should be transported for observation.<br><br>
            • Consider <a class="placeholder-link" title="Coming Soon" href="#">CPAP</a> early if respiratory distress in awake patients, if adequate mask seal can be established.<br><br>
            • Hypothermia is often associated with drowning and submersion injuries even with warm ambient
            conditions.<br><br>
            • Patients who suffer a cardiac arrest from drowning require an “ABC” approach with prompt airway
            management and supplemental breathing.
