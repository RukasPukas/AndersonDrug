          Patients with frostbite will develop numbness involving the affected body part along with a “clumsy” feeling and areas
          of blanched skin - later findings include decreased or loss of sensation, bruising or blister formation, white and waxy
          appearance to affected tissue, or feeling like a block of wood.

              c. Rewarming is complete when frozen area is warm to touch and deep red or bluish in color.<br><br>

        <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
        <strong>Hypothermic Cardiac Arrest</strong><br><br>
        • The following are contraindications for initiation of resuscitation in the hypothermic patient:<br><br>
        <span class="Indention">
            a. Obvious fatal injuries (such as decapitation).<br><br>
            b. The patient exhibits signs of being frozen (such as ice formation in the airway).<br><br>
            c. Chest wall rigidity such that compressions are impossible.<br><br>
            d. Danger to rescuers or rescuer exhaustion
        </span><br>
        • Fixed and dilated pupils, apparent rigor mortis, and dependent lividity may not be contraindication for
        resuscitation in the severely hypothermic patient.<br><br>
        • The mainstay of therapy in severe hypothermia and cardiac arrest should be effective chest compressions
        and attempts at rewarming. Chest compressions should be provided at the same rate as in normothermic
        patients.<br><br>
        • The temperature at which defibrillation should first be attempted in the severely hypothermic cardiac arrest
        victim and the number of defibrillation attempts is unclear. There are different approaches regarding
        resuscitation of the hypothermic arrest patient.<br><br>
        <span class="Indention">
            a. Per the American Heart Association (AHA), if the patient has a shockable rhythm (VF/VT),
            defibrillation should be attempted – it is reasonable to continue defibrillation attempts per AHA
            protocols concurrently with rewarming strategies.
        </span><br>
        • There is little evidence to guide use of medications in severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest, however
        2020 AHA updates to advanced cardiac life support recommends the use of vasopressors but does not
        support the use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for hypothermic patients in cardiac arrest.<br><br>
        • Patients with severe hypothermia and arrest may benefit from resuscitation even after prolonged
        downtime, and survival with intact neurologic function has been observed even after prolonged
        resuscitation.<br><br>

        • Extremes of age are more susceptible (i.e. young and old).<br><br>
        • If the temperature is unable to be measured, treat the patient based on the suspected temperature.<br><br>
        • Given the additive effects of additional cold stress, the patient should be removed from the cold environment as
        soon as operationally feasible.<br><br>
        • In patients suffering from moderate to severe hypothermia, it is critical to not allow these patients to stand or
        exercise as this may cause circulatory collapse.<br><br>
        • Devices that self-generate heat (e.g. heat packs) that are being utilized during the rewarming process should
        be wrapped in a barrier to avoid direct contact with the skin and to prevent burns. In patients who are
        unresponsive, or unable to recognize a developing injury, please check the area in which the heating pad is
        placed regularly to ensure no tissue damage occurs.
