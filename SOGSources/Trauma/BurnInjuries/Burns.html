          1. Assure scene and rescuer safety.<br /><br />

            >INITIAL TRAUMA CARE</a
          >.<br /><br />

          3. Expose the burned area and remove any rings, bracelets or other
          constricting items.<br /><br />

          4. Estimate Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) and depth of burn.<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Use
            <a

            included in TBSA calculations.<br /><br />
            c. The patient’s palm is roughly equal to 1% body surface area which
            can also be used in estimating the percent of the body surface that
            is burned.<br /><br /> </span
          ><br />

          5. If evidence of possible airway burn (burns around face, nares or
          pharynx), consider aggressive airway management per the
          <a
            href="../../General/AirwayManagementSources/AirwayManagement.html"

          Protocol.<br /><br />

          6. Evaluate distal circulation in circumferentially burned
          extremities.<br /><br />

          7. Prevent systemic heat loss and keep the patient warm.<br /><br />

          8. Relay information to incoming ambulance and/or call for intercept
          per
          <a

          <strong><u>Thermal Burns:</u></strong
          ><br /><br />
          1. Stop the burning process with sterile water or normal saline.<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Remove non-adherent clothing and jewelry.<br /><br />
            b. Leave blisters intact. </span

          2. Minimize burn wound contamination.<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Cover burns with dry dressing or clean sheet.<br /><br />
            b. Do not apply gels or ointments. </span

          3. Consider Carbon Monoxide and/or Cyanide poisoning in patients with
          smoke inhalation. Refer to

          Protocols.<br /><br />

          <strong><u>Chemical Burns:</u></strong
          ><br /><br />
          1. If dry chemical contamination, carefully brush off solid chemical
          prior to flushing the site.<br /><br />

          2. If wet chemical contamination, flush the patient’s skin (and eyes,
          if involved) with copious amounts of water or normal saline.<br /><br />

          3. For eye exposure, administer continuous flushing of Normal Saline
          fluid to eye.<br /><br />

          <strong><u>Electrical Burns:</u></strong
          ><br /><br />
          1. Verify scene safety and ensure that the electrical source is
          disabled prior to assessment.<br /><br />
          2. Assess for visible entrance and exit wounds and treat as thermal
          burns.

        <p>
          1. Continue <strong>EMR & BLS TREATMENT</strong>.<br /><br />

          2. Apply cardiac monitor and assess for dysrhythmias, especially in
          electrical injuries.<br /><br />

          3. Establish IV access. Avoid placement through burned skin.<br /><br />

          4. Administer
          <strong
            >Isotonic IV Fluid (500 mL bolus or 1-2mL/kg x %BSA burn over 8
            hours)</strong
          >
          Example: (((2mLx100kg) x 30%))/8)=750 ml/hr. Lactated Ringers is
          preferred over normal saline.

          injury (burns around face, nares or pharynx) are present per the

          • Onset of stridor and change in voice are sentinel signs of
          potentially significant airway burns, which may rapidly lead to airway
          obstruction or respiratory failure. Early intubation is required in
          significant inhalation injuries.<br /><br />
          • EtCO2 monitoring may be particularly useful to monitor respiratory
          status in patients receiving significant doses of narcotic pain
          medication.<br /><br />
          • Particularly in enclosed-space fires, carbon monoxide toxicity is a
          consideration and pulse oximetry may not be accurate.<br /><br />
          • Cardiac monitor is important in electrical burns and chemical
          inhalations.<br /><br />
          • Have a high index of suspicion for cyanide poisoning in a patient
          with depressed GCS, respiratory difficulty and cardiovascular collapse
          in the setting of an enclosed-space fire. Give the antidote
          (hydroxocobalamin), if available, in this circumstance.<br /><br />
          • Pain management is critical in acute burns.<br /><br />
          • TBSA is calculated only based on percent of second (partial
          thickness) and third degree (full thickness) burns – First degree
          (superficial) burns are not included in this calculation.<br /><br />
          • Burn patients are prone to hypothermia—never apply ice or cool burns
          that involve &gt; 10% TBSA.<br /><br />
          • Burn patients are trauma patients; evaluate for multisystem
          trauma.<br /><br />
          • Anticipate atrial and/or ventricular dysrhythmias as well as cardiac
          arrest with electrical injuries.<br /><br />
          • The mortality related to electrical injuries is impacted by several
          factors:<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Route current takes through the body – current traversing the
            heart has higher mortality.<br /><br />
            b. Type of current – AC vs. DC<br /><br />
            <span class="Indention">
              i. AC is more likely to cause cardiac dysrhythmias while DC is
              more likely to cause deep tissue burns however either type of
              current can cause any injury.<br /><br />
              ii. DC typically causes one muscle contraction while AC can cause
              repeated contractions.<br /><br />
              iii. Both types of current can cause involuntary muscle
              contractions that do not allow the victim to let go of the
              electrical source.<br /><br />
              iv. AC is more likely to cause ventricular fibrillation while DC
              is more likely to cause asystole.<br /><br /> </span></span
          ><br />
          • For chemical burns: Normal Saline or Sterile Water is preferred,
          however if not available, do not delay irrigation and use tap water.
          Other water sources may be used based on availability. Flush the area
          as soon as possible with the cleanest readily available water or
          saline solution using copious amounts of fluids.
