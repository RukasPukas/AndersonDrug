          <strong><u>General Treatment:</u></strong><br><br>

          1. Assure scene and rescuer safety.<br><br>

          2. <a href="../InitialSources/Initial.html" class="working-link" title="Initial Trauma Care SOG">INITIAL TRAUMA CARE</a>.<br><br>

          3. Expose the burned area and remove any rings, bracelets or other constricting items.<br><br>

          4. Estimate Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) and depth of burn.<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. Use <a href="../../../ReferenceMaterial/RuleOfNineSources/ruleOfNine.html" class="working-link" title="Rule of 9's Resource Page">“Rule of 9’s”</a>.<br><br>
              b. First-degree (superficial) burns (skin erythema only) are not included in TBSA calculations.<br><br>
              c. The patient’s palm is roughly equal to 1% body surface area which can also be used in
              estimating the percent of the body surface that is burned.<br><br>
          </span><br>
    
          5. If evidence of possible airway burn (burns around face, nares or pharynx), consider aggressive airway
          management per the <a href="../../General/AirwayManagementSources/AirwayManagement.html" class="working-link" title="Airway Management SOG">AIRWAY MANAGEMENT</a> Protocol.<br><br>

          6. Evaluate distal circulation in circumferentially burned extremities.<br><br>

          7. Prevent systemic heat loss and keep the patient warm.<br><br>

          8. Relay information to incoming ambulance and/or call for intercept per 
          <a href="../../General/InterceptCriteriaSources/Intercept.html" class="working-link" title="Intercept Criteria SOG">INTERCEPT CRITERIA</a>.<br><br>

          <strong><u>Thermal Burns:</u></strong><br><br>
          1. Stop the burning process with sterile water or normal saline.<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. Remove non-adherent clothing and jewelry.<br><br>
              b. Leave blisters intact.
          </span><br>

          2. Minimize burn wound contamination.<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. Cover burns with dry dressing or clean sheet.<br><br>
              b. Do not apply gels or ointments.
          </span><br>

          3. Consider Carbon Monoxide and/or Cyanide poisoning in patients with smoke inhalation. Refer to
          <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Coming Soon">CARBON MONOXIDE / SMOKE INHALATION</a> and 
          <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Coming Soon">CYANIDE POISONING</a> Protocols.<br><br>

          <strong><u>Chemical Burns:</u></strong><br><br>
          1. If dry chemical contamination, carefully brush off solid chemical prior to flushing the site.<br><br>

          2. If wet chemical contamination, flush the patient’s skin (and eyes, if involved) with copious amounts of
          water or normal saline.<br><br>

          3. For eye exposure, administer continuous flushing of Normal Saline fluid to eye.<br><br>

          <strong><u>Electrical Burns:</u></strong><br><br>
          1. Verify scene safety and ensure that the electrical source is disabled prior to assessment.<br><br>
          2. Assess for visible entrance and exit wounds and treat as thermal burns.

        </p>
        <h3 class="PARAMEDIC">Paramedic/PHRN</h3>
        <p>
          1. Continue <strong>EMR & BLS TREATMENT</strong>.<br><br>

          2. Apply cardiac monitor and assess for dysrhythmias, especially in electrical injuries.<br><br>

          3. Establish IV access. Avoid placement through burned skin.<br><br>

          4. Administer <strong>Isotonic IV Fluid (500 mL bolus or 1-2mL/kg x %BSA burn over 8 hours)</strong> Example:
          (((2mLx100kg) x 30%))/8)=750 ml/hr. Lactated Ringers is preferred over normal saline.

          5. Consider the need for an advanced airway if signs of inhalation injury (burns around face, nares or pharynx)
          are present per the <a href="../../General/AirwayManagementSources/AirwayManagement.html" class="working-link" title="Airway Management Protocol">AIRWAY MANAGEMENT</a>
          Protocol.
          <br><br>
          Consider early management of pain per the
          <a href="../../General/PainManagementSources/PainManagement.html" class="working-link" title="Pain Management SOG">PAIN MANAGEMENT</a>  Protocol <br><br>

          <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
          • Onset of stridor and change in voice are sentinel signs of potentially significant airway burns, which may
          rapidly lead to airway obstruction or respiratory failure. Early intubation is required in significant
          inhalation injuries.<br><br>
          • EtCO2 monitoring may be particularly useful to monitor respiratory status in patients receiving significant
          doses of narcotic pain medication.<br><br>
          • Particularly in enclosed-space fires, carbon monoxide toxicity is a consideration and pulse oximetry may
          not be accurate.<br><br>
          • Cardiac monitor is important in electrical burns and chemical inhalations.<br><br>
          • Have a high index of suspicion for cyanide poisoning in a patient with depressed GCS, respiratory
          difficulty and cardiovascular collapse in the setting of an enclosed-space fire. Give the antidote
          (hydroxocobalamin), if available, in this circumstance.<br><br>
          • Pain management is critical in acute burns.<br><br>
          • TBSA is calculated only based on percent of second (partial thickness) and third degree (full thickness)
          burns – First degree (superficial) burns are not included in this calculation.<br><br>
          • Burn patients are prone to hypothermia—never apply ice or cool burns that involve &gt; 10% TBSA.<br><br>
          • Burn patients are trauma patients; evaluate for multisystem trauma.<br><br>
          • Anticipate atrial and/or ventricular dysrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest with electrical injuries.<br><br>
          • The mortality related to electrical injuries is impacted by several factors:<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. Route current takes through the body – current traversing the heart has higher mortality.<br><br>
              b. Type of current – AC vs. DC<br><br>
              <span class="Indention">
                  i. AC is more likely to cause cardiac dysrhythmias while DC is more likely to cause deep
                  tissue burns however either type of current can cause any injury.<br><br>
                  ii. DC typically causes one muscle contraction while AC can cause repeated contractions.<br><br>
                  iii. Both types of current can cause involuntary muscle contractions that do not allow the
                  victim to let go of the electrical source.<br><br>
                  iv. AC is more likely to cause ventricular fibrillation while DC is more likely to cause
                  asystole.<br><br>
          </span></span><br>
          • For chemical burns: Normal Saline or Sterile Water is preferred, however if not available, do not delay
          irrigation and use tap water. Other water sources may be used based on availability. Flush the area as
          soon as possible with the cleanest readily available water or saline solution using copious amounts of
          fluids.
