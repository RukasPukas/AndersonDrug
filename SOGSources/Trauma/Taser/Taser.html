          2. Ensure Scene Safety prior to providing patient care.<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Make sure patient is appropriately secured with assistance of law enforcement to protect the
            patient and staff.<br><br>
            b. Once the patient has been appropriately secured or restrained with assistance from law
            enforcement, assessment of patient should also include pulse oximetry.
          </span><br>
          
          3. Confirm device has been turned off and that the barb cartridge has been disconnected from the electrical
          weapon.<br><br>

          4. Obtain vital signs and for onset of secondary SOB/chest pain/palpitations consider 12-lead ECG if
          available for BLS.<br><br>

          5. Patients with conducted electrical weapon (Taser®) barb penetration in vulnerable areas of body as
          mentioned below should be transported to the hospital for further evaluation and probe removal.<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">
            a. Barbs embedded in skin above level of the clavicles, genitalia or female breasts.<br><br>
            b. Suspicion that probe might be embedded in bone, blood vessel or other sensitive structure.
            </span><br>

          6. Barb(s) can be removed if <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> in a vulnerable area listed above, by stabilizing the skin surrounding the
          barb and grasping the barb shaft and pulling straight out with a gentle but quick motion.<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">
            a. Once extracted, visually inspect barb to make sure it is intact and that nothing remains in patient.
            </span><br>

          7. Document the removal location and time of removal in the patient care report.<br><br>

          8. Apply bandage to the area where the barb was removed.<br><br>

          9. Inform the patient that they may need a tetanus shot if they have not received one in the last five years

          1. Continue <strong>EMR & EMT TREATMENT</strong>.<br><br>

          2. Once the patient has been appropriately secured or restrained with assistance from law enforcement, if patient
          appears in distress an assessment of should also include pulse oximetry, 
          <a class="placeholder-link" title="Coming Soon" href="#">capnography</a>, ECG and 12-lead ECG.<br><br>

          3. Consider psychologic management medications if patient is struggling against physical devices and may harm
          themselves or other. Refer to
          <a href="../../AdultMedical/AgitatedSources/Agitated.html" class="working-link" title="Behavioral Emergencies Protocol">BEHAVIORIAL EMERGENCIES</a>  Protocol

          <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
          • Before removal of the barbed dart, make sure the cartridge has been removed from the conducted
          electrical weapon.<br><br>
          • Patient should not be restrained in the prone, face down, or hog-tied position as respiratory compromise is
          a significant risk.<br><br>
          • The patient may have underlying pathology before being tased (refer to appropriate guidelines for
          managing the underlying medical/traumatic pathology).<br><br>
          • Perform a comprehensive assessment with special attention looking for signs and symptoms that may
          indicate excited delirium.<br><br>
          • Transport the patient to the hospital if they have concerning signs or symptoms.<br><br>
          • EMS providers who respond for a conducted electrical weapon patient should not perform a “medical
          clearance” for law enforcement.<br><br>
          • Conducted electrical weapon can be discharged in three fashions:<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. Direct contact without the use of the darts
              b. A single dart with additional contact by direct contact of weapon
              c. From a distance up to 35 feet with two darts
          </span><br>
          • The device delivers 19 pulses per second with an average current per pulse of 2.1 milliamps which in
          combination with toxins/drugs, patient’s underlying diseases, excessive physical exertion, and trauma may
          precipitate arrhythmias, thus consider ECG monitoring and 12-lead ECG assessment.<br><br>
          • Drive Stun is a direct two-point contact weapon which is designed to generate pain and not incapacitate the
          subject. Only local muscle groups are stimulated with the Drive Stun technique.
