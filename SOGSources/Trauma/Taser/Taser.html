          2. Ensure Scene Safety prior to providing patient care.<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Make sure patient is appropriately secured with assistance of law
            enforcement to protect the patient and staff.<br /><br />
            b. Once the patient has been appropriately secured or restrained
            with assistance from law enforcement, assessment of patient should
            also include pulse oximetry. </span
          ><br />

          3. Confirm device has been turned off and that the barb cartridge has
          been disconnected from the electrical weapon.<br /><br />

          4. Obtain vital signs and for onset of secondary SOB/chest
          pain/palpitations consider 12-lead ECG if available for BLS.<br /><br />

          5. Patients with conducted electrical weapon (Taser®) barb penetration
          in vulnerable areas of body as mentioned below should be transported
          to the hospital for further evaluation and probe removal.<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Barbs embedded in skin above level of the clavicles, genitalia or
            female breasts.<br /><br />
            b. Suspicion that probe might be embedded in bone, blood vessel or
            other sensitive structure. </span
          ><br />

          6. Barb(s) can be removed if <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> in a
          vulnerable area listed above, by stabilizing the skin surrounding the
          barb and grasping the barb shaft and pulling straight out with a
          gentle but quick motion.<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Once extracted, visually inspect barb to make sure it is intact
            and that nothing remains in patient. </span
          ><br />

          7. Document the removal location and time of removal in the patient
          care report.<br /><br />

          8. Apply bandage to the area where the barb was removed.<br /><br />

          9. Inform the patient that they may need a tetanus shot if they have
          not received one in the last five years

          1. Continue <strong>EMR & EMT TREATMENT</strong>.<br /><br />

          2. Once the patient has been appropriately secured or restrained with
          assistance from law enforcement, if patient appears in distress an
          assessment of should also include pulse oximetry,

          3. Consider psychologic management medications if patient is
          struggling against physical devices and may harm themselves or other.

          • Before removal of the barbed dart, make sure the cartridge has been
          removed from the conducted electrical weapon.<br /><br />
          • Patient should not be restrained in the prone, face down, or
          hog-tied position as respiratory compromise is a significant risk.<br /><br />
          • The patient may have underlying pathology before being tased (refer
          to appropriate guidelines for managing the underlying
          medical/traumatic pathology).<br /><br />
          • Perform a comprehensive assessment with special attention looking
          for signs and symptoms that may indicate excited delirium.<br /><br />
          • Transport the patient to the hospital if they have concerning signs
          or symptoms.<br /><br />
          • EMS providers who respond for a conducted electrical weapon patient
          should not perform a “medical clearance” for law enforcement.<br /><br />
          • Conducted electrical weapon can be discharged in three fashions:<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Direct contact without the use of the darts b. A single dart with
            additional contact by direct contact of weapon c. From a distance up
            to 35 feet with two darts </span
          ><br />
          • The device delivers 19 pulses per second with an average current per
          pulse of 2.1 milliamps which in combination with toxins/drugs,
          patient’s underlying diseases, excessive physical exertion, and trauma
          may precipitate arrhythmias, thus consider ECG monitoring and 12-lead
          ECG assessment.<br /><br />
          • Drive Stun is a direct two-point contact weapon which is designed to
          generate pain and not incapacitate the subject. Only local muscle
          groups are stimulated with the Drive Stun technique.
