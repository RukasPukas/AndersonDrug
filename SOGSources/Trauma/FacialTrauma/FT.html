            2. Treat specific facial injuries as indicated:<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">
                a. <strong>Lacerations, & Avulsions:</strong> Apply direct pressure /dressing is usually all that is needed to
                control bleeding. If bleeding remains uncontrolled, if available, apply a hemostatic agent/dressing
                directly to the source of bleeding and compress wound(s) for a minimum of 2 minutes. If bleeding
                continues, may remove the dressing and apply additional hemostatic agent/dressing.<br><br>
                b. <strong>Unstable Mandible:</strong> Have suction readily available as patient may not be able to spit /swallow
                effectively. Preferably transport patient sitting upright if no suspected spinal injury.<br><br>
                c. <strong>Eye Trauma:</strong> Place eye shield or cover both eyes with dressing for any significant eye trauma.
                If globe is avulsed, cover with moist saline dressing. Penetrating objects to the eye should be
                stabilized with a moist dressing, cover both eyes with eye shield or dressing to minimize tandem
                eye-movement.<br><br>
                d. <strong>Eye Trauma:</strong> Splash injuries to eyes should be treated in accordance with the first aid measures
                contained within the Material Data Safety Sheet for the known substance. Contact medical control
                if substance is unknown for further guidance. Irrigation can be accomplished by positioning the
                prongs of a nasal cannula prongs to each side of the bridge of the patient’s nose. Use isotonic IV
                solution or sterile water to irrigate for at least 30 minutes. If only one eye is involved, position the
                patient on their side, with the injured eye below the uninjured one to reduce the potential for crosscontamination of the unaffected eye..<br><br>
                e. <strong>Avulsed Tooth:</strong> Avoid touching the root of the avulsed tooth. Do not wipe off tooth. Pick up at
                crown end and rinse off with cool saline or water, if dirty. Place in milk or saline as the storage
                medium.<br><br>
            f. <strong>Epistaxis:</strong> Squeeze nose for 10-15 minutes continuously. May use commercial nose clamp
            </span><br>
            3. Relay information to incoming ambulance and/or call for intercept per
            <a href="../../General/InterceptCriteriaSources/Intercept.html" title="Intercept Criteria SOG" class="working-link">INTERCEPT CRITERIA</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 class="PARAMEDIC">Paramedic/PHRN</h3>
        <p>
            1. Continue <strong>EMR & EMT Treatment</strong><br><br>
            2. Facial tissue can be highly vascularized. Severe avulsions and lacerations may cause significant blood loss and
            a subsequent presentation of shock. Utilize pressure/hemostatic dressings for bleeding control. If needed,
            initiate an infusion of administer <strong>Isotonic IV Fluid (500 ml)</strong> bolus to a target of SBP = 90 mmHg or MAP = 65
            mmHg.<br><br>
            4. Patient airways that are unmanageable, should immediately be secured via 
            <a href="../../General/AirwayManagementSources/AirwayManagement.html" class="working-link" title="Airway Management Protocol">ARIWAY MANAGEMENT</a> protocol.<br><br>
            5. <strong>Epistaxis: <span class="RedColor" style="color: rgb(218, 66, 46);">(ALS)</span> Tranexamic Acid (TXA) 500 mg</strong> saturated gauze inserted to pack nostril(s) or may give
            (5) <strong>100mg/1 mL</strong> doses via atomizer applied to the nostril(s) <strong>500 mg</strong> total given intranasal <strong>(IN)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
             During management of facial injuries that have the potential to compromise a patient’s airway, procedures
            (positioning, suction, bleeding control, intubation) should be performed while minimizing unnecessary
            manipulations of the spine.<br><br>
             Patients with isolated injuries to the eye globe should be transported to a facility capable of providing
            treatment specific to such injuries. Patients should be transported in a calm and gentle manner. (Irrigation is
            contraindicated when there is a penetrating injury or rupture to the eye globe.)<br><br>
             Facial injuries can bleed briskly when lacerated, which may cause the patient to suffer from prolonged and
            significant blood loss. Though uncommon, an adult may develop shock from these injuries.<br><br>
             Swallowed blood secondary to a nose bleed has been known to trigger episodes of nausea, refer to
            <a href="../../AdultMedical/NauseaSources/Nausea.html" class="working-link" title="Nausea/Vomiting SOG">NAUSEA/
            VOMITING</a>  guideline<br><br>
             Facial injuries tend to be “distracting” by nature and unless actively the wound is hemorrhaging or airway is
            compromised, management should not interrupt the primary or rapid trauma assessment.
