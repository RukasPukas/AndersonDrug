      <h2>Spinal Motion Restriction</h2>

      <div class="InitialBody">
        <p>
          <span class="centerBold"><u>Spinal Motion Restriction</u> is defined as application of a cervical collar and maintenance of
          the spine in neutral alignment (long backboard, a scoop stretcher, a vacuum mattress, or
          an ambulance cot). </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="centerBold">Determination of spinal motion restriction should be made by the highest level EMS provider. </span>
        </p>
        <h3 class="AllLevels">All Levels</h3>
        <p>
          1. <strong>Spinal Motion Restriction</strong> is <strong>required</strong> when ANY of the following conditions apply following <u>blunt</u>
          trauma: <i>(When in doubt, apply spinal motion restriction)</i>.<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. <strong>Acutely altered level of consciousness</strong> (e.g., GCS &lt;15, evidence of intoxication)<br><br>
              b. <strong>Midline neck or back pain and&#47;or tenderness</strong>.<br><br>
              c. <strong>Focal neurologic signs and&#47;or symptoms</strong> (e.g., numbness or motor weakness).<br><br>
              d. <strong>Anatomic deformity of the spine</strong>.<br><br>
              e. <strong>Distracting circumstances or injury</strong> (e.g., long bone fracture, degloving, or crush injuries,
              large burns, etc.) or any similar injury that impairs the patient’s ability to contribute to a reliable
              examination.<br><br>
              f. <strong>Communication barrier</strong> (emotional &#47; language &#47; cognitive impairment)
          </span><br>

          2. Spinal Motion Restriction is <u>NOT</u> utilized in penetrating trauma to the head and&#47;or neck without evidence
          of spinal injury.

          3. Patient’s should be allowed to self extricate, if able, from a vehicle after placing a cervical collar, if
          indicated.<br><br>

          4. Keep the head, neck, and torso in alignment by placing the patient on a long backboard, a scoop
          stretcher, a vacuum mattress, or an ambulance cot. <strong>SMR cannot be properly performed with a patient
          placed in a sitting position</strong><br><br>

          5. Helmet removal:<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. If a football helmet needs to be removed, it is recommended to remove the face mask followed
              by manual removal (rather than the use of automated devices) of the helmet while keeping the
              neck manually immobilized - occipital and shoulder padding should be applied, as needed, with
              the patient in a supine position, in order to maintain neutral cervical spine positioning.

          <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
          • When SMR is indicated in adults, apply it to the entire spine due to the risk of noncontiguous injuries<br><br>
          • A critical component of SMR is the application of an appropriate size cervical collar.<br><br>
          • Consider removal of extrication devices during transport only if an adequate number of trained personnel
          are present to minimize unnecessary movement during the removal process.<br><br>
          • The risks of patient manipulation must be weighed against the benefits of device removal.<br><br>
          • If transport time is expected to be short, it may be better to transport a patient on the device and remove it
          on arrival at the hospital.<br><br>
          • Be aware of potential airway compromise or aspiration in immobilized patient with nausea / vomiting, or
          with facial / oral bleeding.<br><br>
          • Excessively tight immobilization straps can limit chest excursion and cause hypoventilation.<br><br>
          • Prolonged immobilization on spine board can lead to ischemic pressure injuries to skin. Pad areas that
          become painful or are prone to tissue breakdown as appropriate while minimizing any unnecessary
          movement.<br><br>
          • In an uncooperative patient, avoid interventions that may promote increased spinal movement.<br><br>
          • The preferred position for all patients with spine management is flat and supine. There are three
          circumstances under which raising the head of the bed to 30 degrees should be considered:<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
              a. Respiratory distress<br><br>
              b. Suspected severe head trauma<br><br>
              c. Promotion of patient compliance
          </span><br>
          • Age alone should not be a factor in decision-making for prehospital spine care, yet the patient’s ability to
          reliably be assessed at the extremes of age should be considered. Communication barriers with infants/
          toddlers or elderly patients with dementia may prevent the provider from accurately assessing the patient.
