          <span class="Indention">
          a. <strong>Penetrating neck wounds:</strong> If penetrating object remains in place, seal and stabilize the object as
          needed with gauze. Penetrating open wounds should be sealed with an occlusive dressing and
          covered with gauze. In the case of a tracheal disruption, sealing of the open neck wound may direct
          bleeding into the airway. Rigorous suction of the airway may be required to maintain patency.<br><br>
          b. <strong>Neck vein distention and tracheal deviation:</strong> Typically a late indicator for a tension
          pneumothorax, Provider should assess for dyspnea, diminished breath sounds and
          hyperresonance which will typically present on the side of the chest opposite of the development of
          tracheal deviation. Neck vein distention found with the presence of hypotension can also be
          suggestive of a tension pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade.<br><br>
          c. <strong>Tunneled (Flat) Neck Veins:</strong> In the presence of hypotension, may be indicative of severe
          hemorrhage internally or externally. Verify that all external bleeding is controlled,<br><br>
          d. <strong>Cervical Spine Deformity:</strong> Assess for “step-offs” which can be a sign of an improper alignment of

          present.

          a. <strong>Penetrating neck wounds:</strong> <a href="#" title="Coming Soon" class="placeholder-link">Orotracheal Intubation</a> and placement of an endotracheal tube may be
          required to isolate the lower airway from bleeding. During placement of the endotracheal tube, the
          tube should be advanced beyond the suspected area of disruption. In the event resistance is
          detected while advancing the ETT, no further attempt should be made to advance the ETT as this

          <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
          • Because of the potential for an introduction of air and the creation of an air embolism, open neck wounds
          should be covered with an occlusive dressing. C-collar should be applied over the dressing to minimize
          movement based on mechanism of injury and presentation of symptoms.<br><br>
          • Objects that have penetrated the neck should not be removed, but instead stabilized in place with an
          occlusive and bulking dressings.<br><br>
          • Neck vein distention while in the presence hypotension or narrowing pulse pressures should create a high
          index of suspicion for a tension pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade.<br><br>
          • Although tracheal deviation will occur opposite of the affected side of a tension pneumothorax, the point of
          deviation is located deeply within the neck which then poses a challenge when attempting to visualize or feel
          for deformity. Looking for deviation alone can be difficult and challenging for determining the presence of a
          tension pneumothorax.<br><br>
          • Tunneled (flat) neck veins in the presence of hypotension can indicate significant loss of blood volume. IV
          fluids should be infused up to a rate that just maintains perfusion (systolic BP=90mm, MAP=65mm)<br><br>
          • A“ Step-off” may be detectable when assessing the posterior neck. It typically indicates that the patient has
          suffered a severe fracture/dislocation of the cervical spine. Often times, it is associated with significant
          weakness , numbness or paralysis to arms and/or legs.<br><br>
