          <span class="Indention">
            a. <strong>Penetrating neck wounds:</strong> If penetrating object
            remains in place, seal and stabilize the object as needed with
            gauze. Penetrating open wounds should be sealed with an occlusive
            dressing and covered with gauze. In the case of a tracheal
            disruption, sealing of the open neck wound may direct bleeding into
            the airway. Rigorous suction of the airway may be required to
            maintain patency.<br /><br />
            b.
            <strong>Neck vein distention and tracheal deviation:</strong>
            Typically a late indicator for a tension pneumothorax, Provider
            should assess for dyspnea, diminished breath sounds and
            hyperresonance which will typically present on the side of the chest
            opposite of the development of tracheal deviation. Neck vein
            distention found with the presence of hypotension can also be
            suggestive of a tension pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade.<br /><br />
            c. <strong>Tunneled (Flat) Neck Veins:</strong> In the presence of
            hypotension, may be indicative of severe hemorrhage internally or
            externally. Verify that all external bleeding is controlled,<br /><br />
            d. <strong>Cervical Spine Deformity:</strong> Assess for “step-offs”
            which can be a sign of an improper alignment of the spine do to
            fractures and/or dislocations . Signs of paralysis, paraesthesia and
            priapism may be present. </span

            and placement of an endotracheal tube may be required to isolate the
            lower airway from bleeding. During placement of the endotracheal
            tube, the tube should be advanced beyond the suspected area of
            disruption. In the event resistance is detected while advancing the
            ETT, no further attempt should be made to advance the ETT as this
            may lead to a complete trachea dissection which has been associated
            with very poor patient outcomes.<br /><br />

          • Because of the potential for an introduction of air and the creation
          of an air embolism, open neck wounds should be covered with an
          occlusive dressing. C-collar should be applied over the dressing to
          minimize movement based on mechanism of injury and presentation of
          symptoms.<br /><br />
          • Objects that have penetrated the neck should not be removed, but
          instead stabilized in place with an occlusive and bulking
          dressings.<br /><br />
          • Neck vein distention while in the presence hypotension or narrowing
          pulse pressures should create a high index of suspicion for a tension
          pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade.<br /><br />
          • Although tracheal deviation will occur opposite of the affected side
          of a tension pneumothorax, the point of deviation is located deeply
          within the neck which then poses a challenge when attempting to
          visualize or feel for deformity. Looking for deviation alone can be
          difficult and challenging for determining the presence of a tension
          pneumothorax.<br /><br />
          • Tunneled (flat) neck veins in the presence of hypotension can
          indicate significant loss of blood volume. IV fluids should be infused
          up to a rate that just maintains perfusion (systolic BP=90mm,
          MAP=65mm)<br /><br />
          • A“ Step-off” may be detectable when assessing the posterior neck. It
          typically indicates that the patient has suffered a severe
          fracture/dislocation of the cervical spine. Often times, it is
          associated with significant weakness , numbness or paralysis to arms
          and/or legs.<br /><br />
