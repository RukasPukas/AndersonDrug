              iii. Check all the connections to system controller.
              iv. Change VAD batteries, and/or change system controller if indicated
              v. Have patient stop all activity and assess for patient tolerance.

          1. Continue <strong>EMR/EMT TREATMENT</strong>.<br><br>
          2. Monitor ECG. If there is a pulse, the rhythm may not correlate with it.<br><br>
          3. Obtain 12-lead ECG. Follow appropriate protocol if STEMI or dysrhythmia present.<br><br>
          4. Establish IV access<br><br>
          5. If VAD is functioning and signs of hypoperfusion are present, administer IV <strong>isotonic fluid (500ml)</strong>, over less than
          15 minutes using a push-pull method of drawing up the fluid in a syringe and pushing it through the IV or
          utilizing a commercial rapid infuser, up to a total of 2-liters or until MAP > 65 mmHg.

           Deciding when to initiate Chest Compressions is very difficult. Consider that chest compressions <strong>may
          cause death by exsanguination</strong> if the device becomes dislodged. However, if the pump has
          stopped the heart will not be able to maintain perfusion and the patient will likely die. Ideally, plan the
          decision in advance with a responsive patient and the VAD coordinator. IF a VAD patient is
          unresponsive and pulseless with a non-functioning pump and has previously indicated a desire for
          resuscitative efforts, begin compression. Contact the VAD coordinator and Medical Control.<br><br>

           You do not need to disconnect the controller or batteries in order to:<br><br>
          <span class="Indention">
          a. Defibrillate or cardiovert<br><br>
          b. Acquire a 12-lead ECG
          </span><br>
      
           Automatic non-invasive cuff blood pressures may be difficult to obtain due to the narrow pulse pressure
          created by the continuous flow pump.<br><br>

           Flow though many VAD devices is not pulsatile and patients may not have a palpable pulse or accurate
          pulse oximetry.<br><br>

           The blood pressure, if measurable, may not be an accurate measure of perfusion.<br><br>
           Ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or PEA may be the patient’s “normal” underlying rhythm.
          Evaluate clinical condition and provide care in consultation with VAD coordinator<br><br>

           The patient’s travel bag should accompany them at all times with back-up controller and spare batteries<br><br>
           If feasible, bring the patient’s power module, cable, and display module to the hospital<br><br>
           All patients should carry a spare pump controller with them<br><br>
           The most common cause for VAD alarms are low batteries or battery failures<br><br>
           Although automatic non-invasive blood pressure cuffs are often ineffective in measuring systolic and
          diastolic pressure, if they do obtain a measurement, the MAP is usually accurate<br><br>
