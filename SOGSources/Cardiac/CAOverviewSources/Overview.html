          <strong><u>Special Circumstances</u></strong
          ><br /><br />

          •<strong> Maternal Arrest:</strong><br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            i. The best hope for fetal survival is maternal survival.<br /><br />

            ii. Position the patient in the supine position with a second
            rescuer performing manual uterine displacement to the left in an
            effort to displace the gravid uterus and increase venous return by
            avoiding aorto-caval compression.<br /><br />

            iii. If manual displacement is unsuccessful, the patient may be
            placed in the left lateral tilt position at 30°. This position is
            less desirable than the manual uterine displacement as chest
            compressions are more difficult to perform in this position.<br /><br />

            iv. Chest compressions should be performed slightly higher on the
            sternum than in the non-pregnant patient to account for elevation of
            the diaphragm and abdominal contents in the obviously gravid
            patient.
            <br /><br />

            v. Defibrillation should be performed as in non-pregnant patients. </span
          ><br />

          • <strong>Respiratory Arrests</strong> (Drowning / Suffocation /
          Asphyxiation / Hanging)<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            i. Prompt attention to airway and ventilation is priority followed
            by high-quality and continuous chest compressions and early
            defibrillation.
          </span>
          <br />

          • <strong>Asystole / PEA</strong><br /><br />

          <span class="Indention">
            i. Survival from PEA or Asystole is based on identifying and
            correcting the CAUSE. Consider a broad differential diagnosis, with
            early and aggressive treatment of possible causes.

              pulseless<br /><br />
