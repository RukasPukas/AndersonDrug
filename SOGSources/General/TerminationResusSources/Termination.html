                • Patient is at least 18 years of age.<br><br>

                <span class="Indention">
                    i. No pulse (carotid and femoral confirmed by two EMS providers)<br><br>
                    ii. No respirations<br><br>
                    iii. No evidence of meaningful cardiac activity (e.g. asystole or wide complex PEA less than 60
                    bpm, no heart sounds)<br><br>
                </span>
                • All <u>three</u> of the following are true:

                <span class="Indention">
                    i. Arrest not witnessed by EMS personnel.<br><br>
                    ii. No Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) after at least 20 minutes of high quality
                    CPR / ACLS with a patent airway and EtCO2 &lt; 10 mmHg.<br><br>
                    iii. No defibrillation delivered / non-shockable rhythm.<br><br>
                </span>
                • No evidence or suspicion of hypothermia.<br><br>

                • All EMS personnel involved in the patient’s care agree that discontinuation of the resuscitation is
                appropriate.<br><br>

                • Contact <strong>MEDICAL CONTROL</strong> to consider termination of resuscitation if patient meets above
                criteria.
                <br><br>
                • For patients with narrow complex PEA with a rate above 40 or refractory and recurrent ventricular
                fibrillation / ventricular tachycardia, consider continuation of resuscitation and transport.<br><br>
                </span>

                <br><br>
                <span class="Indention">
                    • Patient is at least 18 years of age.<br><br>

                    • Resuscitation efforts may be terminated in any <u>blunt</u> trauma patient who, upon EMS arrival, is found
                    to be pulseless, apneic and without organized ECG activity.<br><br>

                    • Resuscitation efforts may be terminated in any <u>penetrating</u> trauma patient who, upon EMS arrival,
                    is found to be pulseless, apneic and without other signs of life, including spontaneous movement,
                    ECG activity and pupillary response<br><br>

                    • Cardiopulmonary arrest patients in whom mechanism of injury does not correlate with clinical
                    condition, suggesting a non-traumatic cause of arrest, should have standard ALS resuscitation
                    initiated. Refer to <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Page coming soon">CARDIAC ARREST</a> Protocol.<br><br>

                    • All EMS personnel involved in the patient’s care agree that discontinuation of the resuscitation is
                    appropriate.<br><br>

                    • Contact MEDICAL CONTROL to consider termination of resuscitation if patient meets above criteria
                    or transport to the nearest hospital will be greater than 15 minutes for a traumatic arrest patient.<br><br>
                </span>
                2. If transport is initiated, resuscitation should be continued until arrival at the receiving hospital.<br><br>

                3. Once termination of resuscitation orders have been received and death confirmation has been made by
                medical control:<br><br>
                <span class="Indention">
                a. Immediately notify the coroner or medical examiners office.<br><br>

                b. Do NOT leave a body unattended. EMS should remain on scene until the coroner arrives or
                law enforcement is on scene.<br><br>

                c. Do NOT remove any property from the body or the scene.

            <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>

                • When there is no response to prehospital cardiac arrest treatment, it is acceptable and often preferable to
                cease futile resuscitation efforts in the field.<br><br>

                • Recent evidence has shown that, in order to capture over 99% of potential survivors from medical cardiac
                arrest (especially VF and pulseless VT arrests), resuscitation should be continued for approximately 40
                minutes. This does not imply, however, that all resuscitations should continue this long (e.g.
                asystolic rhythms)<br><br>

                • Logistical factors should be considered, such as collapse in a public place, family wishes, and safety of
                the crew and public.<br><br>
                
                • Survival and functional neurologic outcomes are unlikely if ROSC is not obtained by EMS. It is dangerous
                to crew, pedestrians, and other motorists to attempt to resuscitate a patient during ambulance transport.<br><br>

                • Quantitative end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements of less than 10 mmHg or falling greater than 25%
                despite resuscitation indicates a poor prognosis and provide additional support for termination.<br><br>

                • In patients with cardiac arrest, prehospital resuscitation is initiated with the goal of returning spontaneous
                circulation before permanent neurologic damage occurs. In most situations, ALS providers are capable of
                performing an initial resuscitation that is equivalent to an in-hospital resuscitation attempt, and there is
                usually no additional benefit to emergency department resuscitation in most cases.<br><br>

                • CPR that is performed during patient packaging and transport is much less effective than CPR done at the
                scene. Additionally, EMS providers risk physical injury while attempting to perform CPR in a moving
                ambulance while unrestrained. In addition, continuing resuscitation in futile cases places other motorists
                and pedestrians at risk, increases the time that EMS crews are not available for another call, impedes
                emergency department care of other patients, and incurs unnecessary hospital charges. Lastly, return of
                spontaneous circulation is dependent on a focused, timely resuscitation. The patient in arrest should be
                treated as expeditiously as possible, including quality, uninterrupted CPR and timely defibrillation as
                indicated.
                <br><br>

                • When cardiac arrest resuscitation becomes futile, the patient’s family should become the focus of the
                EMS providers. Families need to be informed of what is being done, and transporting all cardiac arrest
                patients to the hospital is not supported by evidence and inconveniences the family by requiring a trip to
                the hospital where they must begin grieving in an unfamiliar setting. Most families understand the futility of
                the situation and are accepting of ceasing resuscitation efforts in the field.
