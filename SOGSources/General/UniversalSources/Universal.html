          <strong>Scene Size-Up</strong><br /><br />
          1. Ensure scene safety – identify any hazards.<br /><br />
          2. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). a. Wear
          high-visibility, reflective apparel when deemed appropriate (e.g.
          operations at night or in darkness, on or near roadways).<br /><br />
          3. Determine the number of patients. <br /><br />
          4. Identify the mechanism of injury / nature of illness.<br /><br />
          5. Call for additional resources if needed.
          <br /><br />
          6. Consider declaration of Mass Casualty Incident (MCI), if needed.<br /><br />

          <strong>Initial Assessment / Primary Survey</strong><br /><br />
          (<b>A</b>irway, <b>B</b>reathing, <b>C</b>irculation is cited below;
          although there are specific circumstances where <b>C</b>irculation,
          <b>A</b>irway, <b>B</b>reathing may be indicated such as cardiac
          arrest or major arterial bleeding)<br /><br />

          1. Obtain a general impression of the patient’s condition.<br /><br />

          2. <strong>A</strong>irway<br />
          a. Assess airway patency and open the airway as indicated (e.g.
          head-tilt chin-lift or jaw thrust).<br />
          b. Establish patent airway with cervical spine precautions, per the
          AIRWAY MANAGEMENT and SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION Protocol.<br />
          c. For patients with laryngectomies or tracheostomies, remove all
          objects or clothing that may obstruct the opening of these devices,
          maintain the flow of prescribed oxygen and reposition the head and/or
          neck.<br />
          d. Evaluate mental status for ability to protect airway (patients with
          a GCS less than or equal to 8 are likely to require airway
          protection). <br /><br />

          3. <strong>B</strong>reathing<br />
          a. Evaluate rate, breath sounds, accessory muscle use, retractions,
          patient positioning.<br />
          b. Monitor oxygen saturation and, if indicated, provide supplemental
          OXYGEN with a target of achieving 94-98% saturation for most acutely
          ill patients. **Exception: ACS and CARDIAC ARREST Protocol.<br />
          c. Apnea (not breathing) - go to the AIRWAY MANAGEMENT Protocol.<br /><br />

          4. <strong>C</strong>irculation<br />
          a. Control any major external bleeding. Refer to EXTREMITY TRAUMA /
          EXTERNAL HEMORRHAGE MANAGEMENT Protocol.<br />
          b. Evaluate carotid and radial pulses. If no pulse go to CARDIAC
          ARREST Protocol<br />
          c. Evaluate perfusion by assessing skin color, temperature, condition
          and capillary refill.<br />
          d. Establish IV access and administer isotonic IV FLUID to a target of
          SBP = 90 mmHg or MAP = 65 mmHg. . (ALS ONLY)<br /><br />

          5. Disability a. Asses Level of Consciousness: A – Alert; V – Responds
          to verbal; P – Responds to pain; U – Unresponsive b. Evaluate gross
          motor and sensory function in all extremities. c. Check blood glucose
          in patients with altered level of consciousness and refer to ALTERED
          MENTAL STATUS protocol as appropriate. d. If acute stroke suspected,
          refer to STROKE Protocol. 6. Exposure a. Rapid evaluation of entire
          body to identify injuries. Be considerate of patient modesty. b.
          Prevent hypothermia (remove wet clothing and cover patient to prevent
          further heat loss). 7. Critical Transport Decision - Refer to
          INTERCEPT CRITERIA Protocol.
