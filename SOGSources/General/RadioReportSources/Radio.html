            1. Unit must identify call letters, level of service and city of origin.<br><br>

            <span class="Indention">a. Transport and non-transport agencies may use MERCI, StarCom21, local radio frequency or
            cellular phone to communicate with Medical Control. All methods of communication utilized for
            medical control must be capable of being recorded by those facilities providing it. Providers are not
            to utilize other non-recorded lines of communication to contact medial control unless an unplanned
            event has rendered normal lines of communication as inoperable.<br><br>

            Control for verification and clearly documented in the patient care report.<br><br>

            4. In the event of communications system failure, protocols may be used as listed, including Medical Control
            considerations. Protocol usage secondary to a communication outage must be documented by an EMS
            system approved incident report and submitted to the EMS system office within 24 hours.

            <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>

                • Radio communications is a vital component of prehospital care. Information reported should be concise and
                provide an accurate description of the patient’s condition as well as treatment rendered.<br><br>

                • Early and timely notification of Medical Control or the receiving facility is essential for prompt care to be
                delivered by all involved.<br><br>

                • Whenever possible, the EMS provider responsible for the highest level of direct patient care should call in the
                report.
