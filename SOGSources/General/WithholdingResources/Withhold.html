          2. Do not initiate resuscitation in the following:<br /><br />

          <span class="Indention">
            <strong>Do Not Resuscitate orders:</strong> No resuscitation efforts
            should be initiated when the person or Family has evidence of a
            valid state issued Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order in hand.<br /><br />

            <strong>Scene safety:</strong> The physical environment is not safe
            for the EMS providers to enter. </span
          ><br /><br />

          3. If any of the findings are different than those described above or
          if any of the above criteria are uncertain, clinical death is not
          confirmed and resuscitative measures should be immediately initiated
          or continued. Contact <strong>MEDICAL CONTROL</strong> when able for
          further guidance. <br /><br />

          4. Once death confirmation has been established and resuscitation has
          been withheld:<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Immediately notify the coroner or medical examiner’s office.<br /><br />
            b. Do NOT leave a body unattended. EMS should remain on scene until
            the coroner arrives or law enforcement is on scene.<br /><br />
            c. Do NOT remove any property from the body or the scene.<br /><br />
            d. Never transport / move a body without permission from the
            coroner's office except for assessment or its protection.

          • In cases where the patient's status is unclear and the
          appropriateness of withholding resuscitation efforts is questioned,
          EMS personnel should initiate CPR immediately and then contact direct
          medical oversight.<br /><br />

          • For scene safety and/or family wishes, provider may decide to
          implement CPR even if all the criteria for death are met.<br /><br />

          • At a likely crime scene, disturb as little potential evidence as
          possible.<br /><br />

          • Medical cause or traumatic injury or body condition clearly
          indicating biological death (irreversible brain death), limited to:<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Decapitation: the complete severing of the head from the
            remainder of the patient’s body.<br /><br />
            b. Decomposition or putrefaction: the skin is bloated or ruptured,
            with or without soft tissue sloughed off. The presence of at least
            one of these signs indicated death occurred at least 24 hours
            previously.<br /><br />
            c. Transection of the torso: the body is completely cut across below
            the shoulders and above the hips through all major organs and
            vessels. The spinal column may or may not be severed.<br /><br />
            d. Incineration: 90% of body surface area with full thickness burns
            as exhibited by ash rather than clothing and complete absence of
            body hair with charred skin.<br /><br />
            e. Injuries incompatible with life (such as massive crush injury,
            complete exsanguination, severe displacement of brain matter).<br /><br />
            f. In blunt and penetrating trauma, if the patient is apneic,
            pulseless, and without other signs of life upon EMS arrival
            including, but not limited to spontaneous movement, ECG activity, or
            pupillary response.
