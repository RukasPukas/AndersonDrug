        2. Do not initiate resuscitation in the following:<br><br>

        <span class="Indention">
                <strong>Do Not Resuscitate orders:</strong> No resuscitation efforts should be initiated when the person or
                Family has evidence of a valid state issued Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order in hand.<br><br>

                <strong>Scene safety:</strong> The physical environment is not safe for the EMS providers to enter.
        </span><br><br>

        3. If any of the findings are different than those described above or if any of the above criteria are
        uncertain, clinical death is not confirmed and resuscitative measures should be immediately initiated or
        continued. Contact <strong>MEDICAL CONTROL</strong> when able for further guidance.
        <br><br>

        4. Once death confirmation has been established and resuscitation has been withheld:<br><br>
        <span class="Indention">
            a. Immediately notify the coroner or medical examiner’s office.<br><br>
            b. Do NOT leave a body unattended. EMS should remain on scene until the coroner arrives or
            law enforcement is on scene.<br><br>
            c. Do NOT remove any property from the body or the scene.<br><br>
            d. Never transport / move a body without permission from the coroner's office except for
            assessment or its protection.

      <p>
        <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>

             In cases where the patient's status is unclear and the appropriateness of withholding resuscitation efforts is
            questioned, EMS personnel should initiate CPR immediately and then contact direct medical oversight.<br><br>

             For scene safety and/or family wishes, provider may decide to implement CPR even if all the criteria for
            death are met.<br><br>

             At a likely crime scene, disturb as little potential evidence as possible.<br><br>

             Medical cause or traumatic injury or body condition clearly indicating biological death (irreversible brain
            death), limited to:<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">
                a. Decapitation: the complete severing of the head from the remainder of the patient’s body.<br><br>
                b. Decomposition or putrefaction: the skin is bloated or ruptured, with or without soft tissue sloughed
                off. The presence of at least one of these signs indicated death occurred at least 24 hours
                previously.<br><br>
                c. Transection of the torso: the body is completely cut across below the shoulders and above the hips
                through all major organs and vessels. The spinal column may or may not be severed.<br><br>
                d. Incineration: 90% of body surface area with full thickness burns as exhibited by ash rather than
                clothing and complete absence of body hair with charred skin.<br><br>
                e. Injuries incompatible with life (such as massive crush injury, complete exsanguination, severe
                displacement of brain matter).<br><br>
                f. In blunt and penetrating trauma, if the patient is apneic, pulseless, and without other signs of life
                upon EMS arrival including, but not limited to spontaneous movement, ECG activity, or pupillary
                response.
