            Patients who are identified by the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability,
            and Health that have experienced a decrement in health resulting in some degree of disability. According to the U.S.
            Department of Health and Human Services, this includes, but is not limited to, individuals with physical, sensory,
            mental health, and cognitive and/or intellectual disabilities affecting their ability to function independently without
            assistance.

        <h3 class="AllLevels">All Levels</h3>
        <p>
            1. Identify the functional need by means of information from the patient, the patient’s family, bystanders,
            medic alert bracelets or documents, or the patient’s adjunct assistance devices.<br><br>

            2. The physical examination should not be intentionally abbreviated, although the manner in which the
            exam is performed may need to be modified to accommodate the specific needs of the patient.<br><br>

            3. Medical care should not intentionally be reduced or abbreviated during the triage, treatment, and
            transport of patients with functional needs, although the manner in which the care is provided may need
            to be modified to accommodate the specific needs of the patient.<br><br>

            4. For patients with communication barriers (language or sensory), it may be desirable to obtain
            secondary confirmation of pertinent data (e.g. allergies) from the patient’s family, interpreters, or written
            or electronic medical records. The family members can be an excellent source of information and the
            presence of a family member can have a calming influence on some of these patients.
            Assistance Adjuncts. Examples of devices that facilitate the activities of daily living for the patient with
            functional needs include, but are not limited to:<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">
            a. Extremity prostheses<br><br>
            b. Hearing aids<br><br>
            c. Magnifiers<br><br>
            d. Tracheostomy speaking valves<br><br>
            e. White or sensory canes<br><br>
            f. Wheelchairs or motorized scooters<br><br>
            </span>
            Service Animals - As defined by the American Disabilities Act, “any guide dog, signal dog, or other animal
            individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but
            not limited to guiding individuals with impaired vision, alerting individuals with impaired hearing to intruders
            or sounds, providing minimal protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, or fetching dropped items.”<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">
            a. Services animals are not classified as a pet and should, by law, always be permitted to
            accompany the patient.<br><br>

            b. Service animals are not required to wear a vest or a leash. It is illegal to make a request for
            special identification or documentation from the service animal’s partner. EMS providers may
            only ask the patient if the service animal is required because of a disability and the form of
            assistance the animal has been trained to perform.<br><br>

            c. Animals that solely provide emotional support, comfort, or companionship do not qualify as
            service animals

                        the receiving facility<br><br>
