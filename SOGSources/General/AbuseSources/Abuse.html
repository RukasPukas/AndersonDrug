                <strong>Abuse/Maltreatment:</strong> Any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a
                position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a patient.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Human Trafficking:</strong> When people are abducted or coerced into service and often transported across
                international borders. Signs may include, but are not limited to: patient with branding / tattoos and environmental
                clues such as padlocks and/or doorknobs removed on interior doors, and intact windows that are boarded up.<br><br>

            2. Assessment and history; note any discrepancies in history, environment or interaction.<br><br>

            3. Address and treat any obvious injuries or life-threatening issues per the appropriate protocol.<br><br>

            4. Attempt to preserve evidence whenever possible; however, the overriding concern should be providing
            appropriate emergency care to the patient.<br><br>

            5. If no medical emergency exists, the next priority is safe patient disposition / removal from the potentially
            abusive situation. Call law enforcement for assistance.<br><br>

            6. Do not confront suspected perpetrators of abuse / maltreatment. This can create an unsafe situation for
            EMS and for the patient.<br><br>

            7. For patients transported, report concerns to receiving facility and to the appropriate agency / hotline.<br><br>
            <strong>
            The Illinois EMS Act (210 ILCS 50/3.230) and The Illinois Elder Abuse and Neglect Act (320 ILCS 20/4)
            requires all licensed EMS providers to report suspected cases of elder abuse or neglect. To report, call
            the Elder Abuse hotline at 1-866-800-1409. For Nursing Home abuse/neglect, call 1-800-252-4343.

            <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>
                 Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary with age group of the patient and type of abuse.<br><br>

                 Not all abuse or maltreatment is physical.<br><br>

                 EMS role is to:<br><br><span class="Indention"> 
                a. Document concerns.<br><br>
                b. Assess potentially serious injuries.<br><br>
                c. Disclose concerns to appropriate authorities.<br><br>
                d. Initiate help to get the patient into a safe situation.<br><br>
                e. Not to investigate or intervene beyond the steps above.<br><br>
                f. Leave further intervention to law enforcement personnel.<br><br>
                </span><br><br>
                 Potential clues to abuse / maltreatment from caregivers or general environment:
                <span class="Indention"> <br><br>
                a. Caregiver apathy about patient’s current situation.<br><br>
                b. Caregiver overreaction to questions about situation.<br><br>
                c. Inconsistent histories from caregivers or bystanders regarding what happened.<br><br>
                d. Information provided by caregivers or patient that is not consistent with injury patterns.<br><br>
                e. Injuries not appropriate for patient’s age or physical abilities (e.g. infants with injuries usually
                associated with ambulatory children, elders who have limited mobility with injury mechanisms
                inconsistent with their capabilities).<br><br>
                f. Caregiver not allowing adult patient to speak for themselves, or who appears controlling – pay
                special attention to patients who cannot communicate due to young age or language and/or
                cultural barriers.<br><br>
                g. Inadequate safety precautions or facilities where the patient lives and/or evidence of security
                measures that appear to confine the patient inappropriately.</span><br><br>
                 Potential clues to abuse / maltreatment that can be obtained from the patient:<br><br>
                <span class="Indention">
                a. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing.<br><br>
                b. Age-inappropriate behavior (e.g. adults who are submissive or fearful, children who act in a
                sexually inappropriate way).<br><br>
                c. Pattern burns, bruises, or scars suggestive of specific weaponry used.<br><br>
                d. Evidence of medical neglect secondary to injuries or infections.<br><br>
                e. Unexplained trauma to genitourinary systems or frequent infections to this system.<br><br>
                f. Evidence of malnourishment and/or serious dental problems.
