          <strong>Abuse/Maltreatment:</strong> Any act or series of acts of
          commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a position of power
          over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat
          of harm to a patient. <br /><br />

          <strong>Human Trafficking:</strong> When people are abducted or
          coerced into service and often transported across international
          borders. Signs may include, but are not limited to: patient with
          branding / tattoos and environmental clues such as padlocks and/or
          doorknobs removed on interior doors, and intact windows that are
          boarded up.<br /><br />

          2. Assessment and history; note any discrepancies in history,
          environment or interaction.<br /><br />

          3. Address and treat any obvious injuries or life-threatening issues
          per the appropriate protocol.<br /><br />

          4. Attempt to preserve evidence whenever possible; however, the
          overriding concern should be providing appropriate emergency care to
          the patient.<br /><br />

          5. If no medical emergency exists, the next priority is safe patient
          disposition / removal from the potentially abusive situation. Call law
          enforcement for assistance.<br /><br />

          6. Do not confront suspected perpetrators of abuse / maltreatment.
          This can create an unsafe situation for EMS and for the patient.<br /><br />

          7. For patients transported, report concerns to receiving facility and
          to the appropriate agency / hotline.<br /><br />
          <strong>
            The Illinois EMS Act (210 ILCS 50/3.230) and The Illinois Elder
            Abuse and Neglect Act (320 ILCS 20/4) requires all licensed EMS
            providers to report suspected cases of elder abuse or neglect. To
            report, call the Elder Abuse hotline at 1-866-800-1409. For Nursing
            Home abuse/neglect, call 1-800-252-4343.

          • Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary with age group of the
          patient and type of abuse.<br /><br />

          • Not all abuse or maltreatment is physical.<br /><br />

          • EMS role is to:<br /><br /><span class="Indention">
            a. Document concerns.<br /><br />
            b. Assess potentially serious injuries.<br /><br />
            c. Disclose concerns to appropriate authorities.<br /><br />
            d. Initiate help to get the patient into a safe situation.<br /><br />
            e. Not to investigate or intervene beyond the steps above.<br /><br />
            f. Leave further intervention to law enforcement personnel.<br /><br /> </span

          • Potential clues to abuse / maltreatment from caregivers or general
          environment:
          <span class="Indention">
            <br /><br />
            a. Caregiver apathy about patient’s current situation.<br /><br />
            b. Caregiver overreaction to questions about situation.<br /><br />
            c. Inconsistent histories from caregivers or bystanders regarding
            what happened.<br /><br />
            d. Information provided by caregivers or patient that is not
            consistent with injury patterns.<br /><br />
            e. Injuries not appropriate for patient’s age or physical abilities
            (e.g. infants with injuries usually associated with ambulatory
            children, elders who have limited mobility with injury mechanisms
            inconsistent with their capabilities).<br /><br />
            f. Caregiver not allowing adult patient to speak for themselves, or
            who appears controlling – pay special attention to patients who
            cannot communicate due to young age or language and/or cultural
            barriers.<br /><br />
            g. Inadequate safety precautions or facilities where the patient
            lives and/or evidence of security measures that appear to confine
            the patient inappropriately.</span

          • Potential clues to abuse / maltreatment that can be obtained from
          the patient:<br /><br />
          <span class="Indention">
            a. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing.<br /><br />
            b. Age-inappropriate behavior (e.g. adults who are submissive or
            fearful, children who act in a sexually inappropriate way).<br /><br />
            c. Pattern burns, bruises, or scars suggestive of specific weaponry
            used.<br /><br />
            d. Evidence of medical neglect secondary to injuries or
            infections.<br /><br />
            e. Unexplained trauma to genitourinary systems or frequent
            infections to this system.<br /><br />
            f. Evidence of malnourishment and/or serious dental problems.
