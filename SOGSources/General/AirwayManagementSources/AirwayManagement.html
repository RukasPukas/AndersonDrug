          3. Administer OXYGEN with a target of achieving 94-98% saturation for
          most acutely ill patients. <br /><br />

          4. Consider inserting an oropharyngeal (OPA) or nasopharyngeal (NPA)

          5. Assist ventilations with a bag-valve-mask (BVM) and supplemental

          <span class="Indention"
            >a. Two-person, two-thumbs-up BVM ventilation is more effective than

          1. For apnea / respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure

        <h3 class="PARAMEDIC">PARAMEDIC / PHRN</h3>
        <p>
          1. Continue EMR / EMT TREATMENT.<br /><br />

          2. When less-invasive methods (BVM,
          <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Page coming soon">BIAD</a
          >) are ineffective, consider
          <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Page coming soon"
            >OROTRACHEAL INTUBATION</a
          >.<br /><br />

            <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Page coming soon"
              >waveform capnography</a
            >
            is mandatory for all intubations.<br /><br />

            b. Video laryngoscopy may enhance intubation success rates and
            should be used when available.<br /><br />

            c. Limit of 2 total intubation attempts per patient.

            <br /><br /><span class="Indention"
              >i. Evaluate reason for failure and change technique or person
              attempting to increase chance of success.</span
            ><br /><br
          /></span>

          3. If managing a breathing patient’s airway, determine if the patient
          is relaxed / flaccid enough for intubation. If not, consider employing
          the
      <a href="../AssistedIntubation/AssistedIntubation.html" class="working-link" title="Assisted (Medication) Protocol" >ASSISTED (MEDICATION) INTUBATION</a>
          Protocol. <br /><br />

          4. If successful intubation, perform post-intubation management
          procedures including: <br /><br />

          <span class="Indention">
            a. Verification of proper placement with
            <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Page coming soon"
              >waveform capnography</a
            >, absent gastric sounds, and bilateral breath sounds.<br /><br />

            b. Note the centimeter marking of the ET tube adjacent to the teeth
            or lips. <br /><br />

            c. Secure the ET tube with a commercial device or tape.</span
          >
          <br /><br />
          5. Ventilate with minimal volume in order to see chest rise,
          approximately 6-7 mL/kg Ideal Body Weight. <br /><br />

          <span class="Indention"
            >a. Avoid hyperventilation. Maintain EtCO2 of 35-45 mmHg </span
          ><br /><br />

          6. Continuously monitor placement with
          <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Page coming soon"
            >waveform capnography</a
          >
          during treatment and transport. <br /><br />

          7. When a “can’t ventilate, can’t intubate” situation occurs and ALL
          attempts to manage the airway and ventilate the patient have failed,
          the paramedic should utilize a surgical airway device. Only providers
          that are trained to do so should perform a cricothyroidotomy using an
          EMS System approved cricothyroidotomy device or technique. Refer to
          <a href="#" class="placeholder-link" title="Page coming soon"
            >CRICOTHRYOIDTOMY</a
          >
          Procedure.<br /><br />

          8. Once the device is successfully inserted follow the post intubation
          management procedure above and secure the 6.0 mm endotracheal tube.
          Ventilate with 100% oxygen.

          <strong>PEARLS</strong><br /><br />
          • Avoid excessive pressures or volumes during BVM. Ventilate with
          minimal volume to see chest rise, approximately 6-7 mL/kg ideal body
          weight<br /><br />

          • Endotracheal intubation remains the “golden standard” for airway
          control. However, since it can also be associated with aspiration,
          oral trauma, worsening of cervical spine injury, malposition of the ET
          tube (right mainstem intubation, esophageal intubation), or adverse
          effects of sedation, especially in children, less experienced
          providers should consider less invasive methods such as a BIAD
          (unconscious only).<br /><br />

          • An Intubation Attempt is defined as passing the laryngoscope blade
          past the teeth.<br /><br />

          • Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM): Appropriately-sized masks should completely
          cover the nose and mouth and maintain an effective seal around the
          cheeks and chin<br /><br />

          <span class="Indention"
            >a. Ventilation should be delivered with only sufficient volume to
            achieve chest rise <br /><br />

            b. Ventilation rate: <br /><br />

            <span class="Indention">
              i. During CPR with an advanced airway, ventilation rate should be
              10 breaths per minute, one breath every 10 compressions (or one
              breath every 6 seconds). Ideally ventilations should be on the
              upstroke between two chest compressions. <br /><br />

              ii. In adults who are not in cardiac arrest, ventilate at rate dof
              12 breaths per minute. <br /><br />

              iii. In children who are not in cardiac arrest, ventilating
              breaths should be delivered over one second, with a two second
              pause between breaths (20 breaths/minute).:</span
            ></span
          >
          <br /><br />

          • Orotracheal intubation:<br /><br />

          <span class="Indention"
            >a. Approximate depth of insertion = (3) x (endotracheal tube size).
            <br /><br />
            b. In addition to pre-oxygenation, apneic oxygenation (high-flow
            oxygen @ 15 LPM by nasal cannula) may prolong the period before
            hypoxia during an intubation attempt. <br /><br />

            c. Appropriate attention should be paid to adequate pre-oxygenation
            to avoid peri-intubation hypoxia and subsequent cardiac arrest.
            <br /><br />

            d. Prompt suctioning of soiled airways before intubation attempt may
            improve first pass success.<br /><br />

            e. Confirm successful placement with waveform capnography. Less
            optimal methods of confirmation include bilateral chest rise,
            bilateral breath sounds, and maintenance of adequate oxygenation.
            Color change on EtCO2 is less accurate than clinical assessment, and
            wave-form capnography is superior. Misting observed in the tube is
            not a reliable method of confirmation. Visualization with video
            laryngoscopy, when available, may assist in confirming placement
            when unclear due to capnography failure or conflicting
            information.</span
