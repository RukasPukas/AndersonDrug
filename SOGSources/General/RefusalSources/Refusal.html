            Criteria</span><br>
            • Patient refuses treatment, transport or requests transport to facility other than closest, most appropriate
            facility.<br><br>
            • Patient is > 18 years old, or an emancipated minor.<br><br>
            • Patient is &lt;
             18 years old, and one of the following:<br><br>
            <span class="Indention">a. Legal guardian is present.<br><br>
            b. Legal guardian contacted from the scene and consents to refusal.</span><br><br>

            • Patient or legal guardian is competent and has the mental capacity to make an informed decision.<br><br>

            <span class="Indention">a. Patient is alert, oriented and has the ability to understand the circumstances surrounding his / her
            illness or impairment, as well as the possible risks associated with refusing treatment and/or
            transport.<br><br>

            b. The individual’s judgement must also not be significantly impaired by illness, injury or drugs / alcohol
            intoxication.</span><br><br>
            • Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal intent, or have other factors that lead EMS
            providers to suspect suicidal intent, should not be regarded as having decision-making capacity and may not
            decline transport to a medical facility.
        </p>
        <h2 class="AllLevels">All Levels</h2>
        <p>
            1. Ensure all refusal criteria are met in accordance with your EMS System Patient Refusal Policy.<br><br>
            
            2. Obtain a complete set of vital signs and complete an initial assessment, paying particular attention to the
            individual’s neurologic and mental status.<br><br>

            3. Determine the individual’s capacity to make a valid judgement concerning the extent of his / her illness or
            injury. If the EMS provider has doubts about whether the individual has the mental capacity to refuse or if
            the patient lacks capacity, the EMS provider should contact Medical Control.<br><br>

            4. Ask patient or guardian to explain reasons for refusal.<br><br>

            5. Clearly explain to the individual and all responsible parties the possible risks and overall concerns with
            regards to refusing care.<br><br>

            6. If patient or guardian does not demonstrate understanding risks of refusal, initiate care under implied
            consent.<br><br>

            7. If refusal represents a significant risk to the patient, based upon mechanism of injury or severity of illness,
            contact Medical Control for advice.<br><br>

            8. Perform appropriate medical care with consent of the individual.<br><br>

            9. If all criteria are met for refusal and risks of refusal have been explained, with reasonable understanding
            demonstrated by patient or guardian, refusal can be accepted and patient or guardian should sign refusal
            form.<br><br>

            10. If patient or guardian is unable or unwilling to sign, document circumstances.<br><br>

            11. Contact Medical Control as necessary.<br><br>

            12. Complete the patient care report clearly documenting the initial assessment findings and the discussions
            with all involved individuals regarding the possible consequences of refusing additional prehospital care
            and/or transportation<br>

            <strong>PEARLS</strong><br><br>

            • Refer to your EMS System Patient Refusal Policy.<br><br>
            
            • An adult or emancipated minor who has demonstrated possessing sufficient mental capacity for making
            decisions has the right to determine the course of his / her medical care, including the refusal of care. These
            individuals must be advised of the risks and consequences resulting from refusal of medical care.<br><br>

            • An individual identified as someone who potentially lacks the decision-making capacity by EMS providers,
            should not be allowed to refuse care without first contacting medical control. Physicians have the legal
            authority to determine an individual’s mental capacity. Because of the physician’s reliance on personnel in
            the field to accurately convey their assessment findings while making a determination of capacity, it is
            recommended to collaborate such findings with on scene mental health workers or law enforcement
            personnel.<br><br>

            • Mental illness, drugs, alcohol intoxication, or physical / mental impairment may significantly impair an
            individual’s decision-making capacity. Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal intent, or
            have other factors that lead EMS providers to suspect suicidal intent, should not be regarded as having
            demonstrated sufficient decision-making capacity.<br><br>

            • The determination of decision-making capacity may be challenged by communication barriers or cultural
            differences.
